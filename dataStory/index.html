        <p> Queens school districts remain the most overcrowded in the city, raising concerns about education quality for immigrant and English Language Learner students.</p>

            <p> New York City has been grappling with oversized classrooms, and while for decades, advocates have pushed to make classrooms smaller, 
                it wasn't until 2022, when Governor Hochul enacted <a href="https://www.p12.nysed.gov/mgtserv/C4E/doc/nyc_class_size_reduction_plan/2023-24/nycps-class-size-redution-plan-2023-24.pdf">Chapter 556 of the Laws of 2022</a>. This legislation requires the New York City school district 
                to create a five-year class size reduction plan for all New York City K-12 community districts and high schools. 
                </p> 
            
            <p>Each cohort has a different legal class size cap—K–3, 4–8, and 9–12 all have separate limits. For grades 4–8, where the legal cap is 23 students, 
                the map shows that about 51% of classes exceed this limit. Queens is the most affected borough, experiencing the highest levels of overcrowding. 
                In April, the city announced it will <a href="https://www.chalkbeat.org/newyork/2025/04/09/nyc-approves-school-class-size-reduction-plans/">hire 3,700 new teachers</a> but haven't stated if more vulnerable school districts will be prioritized.

               <iframe title="Class Size Distribution Across NYC School Districts (Grades 4–8)" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-vPWFt" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vPWFt/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="772" data-external="1"></iframe>
            
            <p>While a lack of teachers is one part of the problem, there are conditions that must be addressed, in order for the DOE to be compliant with the law. 
               Leonie Haimson, executive director of Class Size Matters says the problem is that there are not enough schools being built quickly or progressively enough. 
                </p>
            
            <p>“That's been a long standing problem of the DOE and the school construction Authority,” says Haimson.
            </p>
            <p>She also points out an issue about many parts of the city where there are half empty schools sitting right near overcrowded schools of the same grade levels, 
                and DOE refuses to do anything to adjust or equalize enrollment across schools, even nearby schools. 

                “Parents across New York City are competing for spots in the top 12 schools for their children,” says Naveed Hasan, 46, a father of two public school students 
                in Upper Manhattan.
            </p>
            <p>Queens has the highest concentration of immigrants in the city, a number that has surged with the recent influx of asylum seekers. This has placed increased strain on schools, 
               particularly for English Language Learner (ELL) students where nearly <a href="https://infohub.nyced.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/2023-24-ell-demographics-at-a-glance.pdf">35% of all ELL students</a> in New York City attend schools in Queens.
                
               Chancellor Aviles Ramos' office was contacted for comment but did not respond.
            </p>
            
            <p>Studies show that ELL students need more individualized attention. According to the <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9499343/pdf/JSLHR-65-1574.pdf">study</a>“The Role of Attention, Language Ability, and Language Experience in Children’s 
                Artificial Grammar Learning”, performance in the high attention condition was significantly worse than performance in the low attention condition. Children with strong 
                language skills did much better when they had to pay close attention, compared to those with weaker skills. Even though the children differed in background, language 
                ability, and thinking skills, monolingual and bilingual kids performed about the same in both situations.</p>
                
               <p> Lara Evangelista, executive director of Internationals Network—a nonprofit organization that supports immigrant, refugee, and multilingual students—says that in larger class sizes, 
                the first students to ask for help often aren’t English Language Learners (ELLs), who may not yet feel comfortable approaching the teacher in English. </p>
            
            <p>“Sometimes you walk into a classroom and they’re sitting in the back with their heads down,” she says. “It’s easy for them to get lost in those settings, and the teacher’s job becomes even harder.”  
            </p>
                   
            <p> Hasan says his children’s class sizes have decreased as more space became available to divide students into smaller groups. “With fewer kids in the class, the teachers have been able to give more 
                attention and emotional support. My kids really feel the difference,” he says.</p>
