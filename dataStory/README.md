## Data Story Methodology

For this data story, I wanted to report on an education story, especially focused on overcrowding in classrooms. I wanted to look at where the overcrowding was happening the most. I retrieved the data from NYC Open Data and the most recent data was from 2022. The data included class sizes from K-12 but after reading the legislation implemented in 2022 to reduce class sizes, I noticed that the compliance differed between clusters of grades. I chose to look at one group, which was grades 4-8, which had a legal cap of 23 students. I then took the average class size for each district, and found out how many districts were over the legal cap which was 17 districts out of 32. I then created a heat map with the average classes for each district in the city. Just by looking at the map, it is evident that Queens districts are experiencing the most overcrowding. 

After doing some research I realized that Queens was home to the most immigrants, especially in recent years, and had the highest population of ELL students. I also realized that this may be impacting their learning experience as another layer added to the limitations of larger class sizes. I wanted to see how teachers in Queens were impacted by these overcrowded classrooms and if they had ELL or immigrant students to speak on their observations. Although I put out multiple callouts, I wasnâ€™t able to get in contact with anyone. 

In April, the city announced that it will be hiring 3,700 students, and I immediately thought about which schools will be prioritized. I reached out to Chancellor Aviles Ramos' office but didn't receive a response. 

Near the end of my reporting, I received more updated data from 2024-2025 that I did not have time to analyze, so to continue this story I would continue to reach out to officials to understand their plan more as they enter years 4 and 5 of their class size reduction plan. I would also go to Community Education Council meetings, which might be more viable in the late summer/early fall, and update the data to match the most numbers.
